This repository is designed to allow me to showcase the work and the learning in the HyperionDev (CoGrammar) boot camp that I will shortly be completing.

I will be adding folders to this repository so please do check back regularly to see what is new. My next upload will be a full stack implementation. It will comprise of a React frontend application that allows for full CRUD operations on a database of "car" objects served via an Express backend with a connection via Mongoose to a MongoDB collection.

In the meantime, please feel free to explore any code samples made available here and as the very intensive but enjoyable Bootcamp completes, I hope to have more time and more coding projects to make avaialable here !!
