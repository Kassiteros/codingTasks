This repository is designed to allow me to showcase the work and the learning in the HyperionDev (CoGrammar) boot camp that I am completing.

I will be adding folders so please do check back to see what is new. My next upload will be a full stack implementation with a frontend React application that allows for full CRUD operations on a databse of "car" objects which are served via an Express backend with a connection via Mongoose to a MongoDB collection.
